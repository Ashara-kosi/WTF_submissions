        <h2><em>What is women empowerment?</em></h2>
        <p>Women’s empowerment can be defined to promoting women’s sense of self-worth, their ability to determine their own choices, and their right to influence social change for themselves and others.<br>
            It is closely aligned with female empowerment – a fundamental human right that’s also key to achieving a more peaceful, prosperous world.
        </p>
            <p>In Western countries, female empowerment is often associated with specific phases of the women’s rights movement in history.</p>
            <p>This movement tends to be split into three waves,</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The first beginning in the 19th and early 20th century where suffrage was a key feature.</li>
                <li>The second wave of the 1960s included the sexual revolution and the role of women in society. </li>
                <li>Third wave feminism is often seen as beginning in the 1990s.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Women’s empowerment and promoting women’s rights have emerged as a part of a major global movement and is continuing to break new ground in recent years.<br>
                 Days like <strong>International Women’s Empowerment Day</strong>  are also gaining momentum.<br>
                But despite a great deal of progress, women and girls continue to face discrimination and violence in every part of the world.<a href="https://www.worldvision.com.au/womens-empowerment">"Source"</a>

            <h2><em>Need for Women Empowerment</em></h2>
            <p>Women’s empowerment is not simply a trendy idea; it is essential in today’s society. 
                Despite considerable advancements in women’s rights as well as gender equality, there are still many obstacles and problems that prevent women from contributing fully to society and reaching their full potential. 
                <strong>The following are some strong arguments in favor of women’s empowerment:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Gender equality:</strong>
                        The empowerment of women is necessary to achieve gender equality. Social conventions, cultural practices, as well as discriminatory attitudes that restrict women’s prospects and undercut their rights are at the heart of gender disparity. 
                        By empowering women, we question these expectations and work to create a society where men and women are afforded the same rights, opportunities, and obligations.

                        <strong>Economic development:</strong>
                        Economic growth and the empowerment of women are intimately related. 
                        Half of the world’s population is made up of women, and economic sustainability depends on their active engagement. 
                        Whenever women have the same opportunity for education, work, and entrepreneurship, they make a substantial contribution to economic production, the eradication of poverty, and general development.

                        <strong>Education and Knowledge</strong>
                        A potent strategy for changing civilizations is educating and empowering women. 
                        Women who have received an education are more educated, more competent, and more self-assured, which empowers them to question gender norms and actively engage in social, economic, and political realms. 
                        Education increases a woman’s propensity to make investments in her family’s welfare, especially the health and education of her children, which helps future generations and breaks the cycle of poverty. 
                        Perfect examples of women empowerment program in education are;
                        
                            <ul>
                            <li>Women Techsters Fellowship</li>
                            <li>Tech4dev bootcamp cohort.2.6</li>
                            <li>Women in data Africa</li>
                            <li>Alx women fellowship</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Violence and Descrimination:</strong>
                    In order to overcome violence and prejudice against women, women must be empowered. Domestic abuse, sexual harassment, as well as human trafficking are just a few of the violent crimes against women that they still have to deal with. 
                    Challenges to these harmful practices, safer settings, and the advancement of a culture of equality and respect are made possible by the empowerment of women via education, awareness, & legal protection.

                    <strong>Leadershipp and Decision-making:</strong>
                    In order to create effective policies, strategies, as well as decision-making processes, women’s voices and views are crucial. 
                    For inclusive governance to be promoted and to fulfill the many demands and objectives of society, gender parity in leadership roles must be attained in the private as well as public sectors. 
                    Women’s empowerment ensures that they have an equal voice in decisions that impact their communities and way of life.

## ASSIGNMENT ONE 
1.	Write a function to calculate the multiplication and sum of two numbers.
2.	Write a function to print the sum of the current number and the previous numberr
3.	Write a function to print characters from a string that are present at an even index number
4.	Write a function to rremove first characters from a string
5.	Write a function to check if the first and last number of a list is the same
6.	 Write a function to print multiplication table from 1 to 10
7.	Given a two list of numbers, write a function to create a new list such that the new list should contain odd numbers from the first list and even numbers from the second list.


## ASSIGNEMENT TWO

1. Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print
all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers.
For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:0 EVEN 1 ODD 2 EVEN 3 ODD

2. Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0
and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10,
12, 15, 18, 20.

3. Write a function called show_stars(rows). If rows is 5, it should print the
following:***************

4. Write a function that prints all the prime numbers between 0 and limit where limit is a
parameter.

5. Write a program (function!) that takes a list and returns a new list that contains all the
elements of the first list minus all the duplicates.

6. Write a function to ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is
prime or not.

7. Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers to generate and then
generates them.

8. Write a function that ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a
palindrome or not.

9. Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in
order from smallest to largest) and another number.

10. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a
message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years ol

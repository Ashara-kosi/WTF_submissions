print("Hello World")
#congratulations to me, i just printed my first line of code in python
print("My name is JULIET")
#syntax in python is like following the rules and regulations in python, failure to follow these set of rules will throw an error in your code
#indentation
#indentation error means your code aint aligned properly as supposed to eg
#  print("My surname is ozoagu")

#IDE-INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT: THESE ARE VARIOUS PLATFORMS WHERE WRITING OF CODES, DEBUGGING AND TRACING VARIOUS VARIABLES IS BEING CARRIED OUT
# Examples of an IDE includr pycham. vs code, jupyter notebook, glogle collab
#EPRESSION IN PYTHON
# 1. PRINT FUNCTION : It is a way of commanding the python to reture an output when an input is being made or given . example
print( 1+4+3)
print(42)
#note that STRING means a character or text which must be put in quote while
# integers are numbers which are not put in quote
print(1+3*4)
# a variable is like when you asign something. it is like a placeholder. examples
a = 1+3*4
print(a)
# this implies that we want to put 1+3*4 in a. ie whenever we call a the sum and multiplication of this should be display
b = (1+3)*4
print(b)
print(25)
#DIVISION in Python is represented using  two backward slash// examples.
a= 35//5
print(a)
b= 145//10
print(b)
# note that when we divided 145 by 10 , it output 14 instead of 14.5. This to tell us that in using a divison , only the integer or whole number is shown but to view the remainder, MODULES IS BE USED.
b = 145 % 10
print(b)
#MODULES is represented by %
#print() parameters in python. Parameters are what enters a function when it is being called
#print("my name is Ozoagu" , sep="," , end="Juliet Oluchi")
#print("my name is Ozoagu" , "," , end="Juliet Oluchi")

#Escape Sequences examples
# print("my name is juliet \t I am a winner")
#print("my name is juliet \n I am a winner")
#print("my name is juliet \b I am a winner")
#print("Juliet saidd 'she is a winner'")

# Getting an information from a user. if may maybe you are coding something and it requires you to get an information from a user, INPUT FUNCTION IS BE USED TO DO THAT
#name =input("what is your name")
#print(name)
#print('{2} {1} {0}'.format('Directions','Read','The'))

#Num1 = int(input("what is your first number"))
#Num2 = int(input("what is your second number"))
#Ans = Num1 + Num2
#print(f'{Num} + {Num2} = {Ans}')
#name = input("what is your name")
#print(name)
# num1 = int(input("what is your first number"))
# print(num1)
#num2 = int(input("what is your second number"))
#ans = num1 + num2
#print(f'{num1} + {num2} = {ans}')
#rint("Invalid input. Please enter valid numbers.")
